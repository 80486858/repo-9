    # ideally we'd make sure that if go-bindata generated new content, we fail.
    # because devs should have run go-bindata and checked in changes already.
    # but because git checkout will change the timestamps and mode, it'll generate slight differences, and it's hard to filter those out
    # so for now, we just let it slip and assume devs will do a good enough job maintaining the generated data

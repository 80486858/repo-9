# TCP Interface

Admin commands that you can execute on a live carbon-relay-ng daemon.
Note: you can also have carbon-relay-ng execute these commands at bootup via the init.cmds setting, although that is deprecated in favor of the proper [config file](config.md)


commands:

    help                                         show this menu
    view                                         view full current routing table

    addBlack <prefix|sub|regex> <substring>      blacklist (drops matching metrics as soon as they are received)

    addRewriter <old> <new> <max>                add rewriter that will rewrite all old to new, max times
                                                 use /old/ to specify a regular expression match, with support for ${1} style identifiers in new

    addAgg <func> <match> <fmt> <interval> <wait> [cache=true/false] add a new aggregation rule.
             <func>:                             aggregation function to use
               avg
               count
               delta
               derive
               last
               max
               min
               stdev
               sum
             <match>
               regex=<str>                       mandatory. regex to match incoming metrics. supports groups (numbered, see fmt)
               notRegex=<str>                    regex to check against incoming metrics, inverted (only metrics where the regex doesn't match pass)
               sub=<str>                         substring to match incoming metrics before matching regex (can save you CPU)
               notSub=<str>                      inverted substring filter, metrics which do not contain this string pass the filter
               prefix=<str>                      prefix to match incoming metrics before matching regex (can save you CPU). If not specified, will try to automatically determine from regex.
               notPrefix=<str>                   inverted prefix filter, metrics which do not start with this string pass the filter
             <fmt>                               format of output metric. you can use $1, $2, etc to refer to numbered groups
             <interval>                          align odd timestamps of metrics into buckets by this interval in seconds.
             <wait>                              amount of seconds to wait for "late" metric messages before computing and flushing final result.


    addRoute <type> <key> [opts]   <dest>  [<dest>[...]] add a new route. note 2 spaces to separate destinations
             <type>:
               sendAllMatch                      send metrics in the route to all destinations
               sendFirstMatch                    send metrics in the route to the first one that matches it
               consistentHashing                 distribute metrics between destinations using a hash algorithm
             <opts>:
               prefix=<str>                      only take in metrics that have this prefix
               notPrefix=<str>                   only take in metrics that don't have this prefix
               sub=<str>                         only take in metrics that match this substring
               notSub=<str>                      only take in metrics that don't match this substring
               regex=<regex>                     only take in metrics that match this regex (expensive!)
               notRegex=<regex>                  only take in metrics that don't match this regex (expensive!)
             <dest>: <addr> <opts>
               <addr>                            a tcp endpoint. i.e. ip:port or hostname:port
                                                 for consistentHashing routes, an instance identifier can also be present:
                                                 hostname:port:instance
                                                 The instance is used to disambiguate multiple endpoints on the same host, as the Carbon-compatible consistent hashing algorithm does not take the port into account.
               <opts>:
                   prefix=<str>                  only take in metrics that have this prefix

                   regex=<regex>                 only take in metrics that match this regex (expensive!)

                   spool={true,false}            enable spooling for this endpoint
                   connbuf=<int>                 connection buffer (how many metrics can be queued, not written into network conn). default 30k
                   iobuf=<int>                   buffered io connection buffer in bytes. default: 2M
                   spoolbuf=<int>                num of metrics to buffer across disk-write stalls. practically, tune this to number of metrics in a second. default: 10000
                   spoolmaxbytesperfile=<int>    max filesize for spool files. default: 200MiB (200 * 1024 * 1024)
                   spoolsyncevery=<int>          sync spool to disk every this many metrics. default: 10000
                   spoolsyncperiod=<int>         sync spool to disk every this many milliseconds. default 1000
                   spoolsleep=<int>              sleep this many microseconds(!) in between ingests from bulkdata/redo buffers into spool. default 500
                   unspoolsleep=<int>            sleep this many microseconds(!) in between reads from the spool, when replaying spooled data. default 10

# a plain carbon route that sends all data to the specified carbon (graphite) server (note the double space separating route options from destination options)
#'addRoute sendAllMatch carbon-default  your-graphite-server:2003 spool=true pickle=false',

# example route for https://grafana.com/cloud/metrics (note the double space separating route options from destination options)
#'addRoute grafanaNet grafanaNet  your-base-url/metrics your-grafana.net-api-key /path/to/storage-schemas.conf',

# ignore hosts that don't set their hostname properly via prefix match
#'addBlack prefix collectd.localhost',

#'addBlack regex ^foo\..*\.cpu+',

# aggregate timer metrics with sums
#'addAgg sum regex=^stats\.timers\.(app|proxy|static)[0-9]+\.requests\.(.*) stats.timers._sum_$1.requests.$2 10 20 cache=true',

# all metrics with '=' in them are metrics2.0, send to carbon-tagger service (note the double space separating route options from destination options)
#'addRoute sendAllMatch carbon-tagger sub==  127.0.0.1:2006',

# send to the first carbon destination that matches the metric (note the double spaces between destinations and route)

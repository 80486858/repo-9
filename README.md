# xorfilter

This repository hosts a Rust library implementing
[xor filters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08258). Daniel Lemire's
[go implementation](https://github.com/FastFilter/xorfilter) provides a useful
summary of their benefits and listing of other xor filter libraries.

Xor filters operate on 64-bit unsigned keys. Details on usage of the filters can
be found in the library documentation.
